'''
Consider the following string declaration which is part of the output of a Linux command.
my_str = 'wlo1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr b4:6d:83:77:85:f3'
Write a Python script that extracts the MAC address (b4:6d:83:77:85:f3) from the string.
Try to solve the challenge in more than one way.

my_str = 'wlo1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr b4:6d:83:77:85:f3'
mac_address_s1 = my_str.split() # solution 1
print(f'MAC Address -> {mac_address_s1[-1]}')

mac_address_s2 = my_str[-1:-18:-1] # solution 2
print(f'MAC Address -> {mac_address_s2[::-1]}')
